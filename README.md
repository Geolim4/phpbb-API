phpbb-API [FINAL]
=========

That MOD will provide to your board a RESTfull API able to communicate in many format: JSON, XML, HTML etc.

You can grab some posts/topics/forums/groups infos etc... The API will provide a special administrator access using admin-key privileges like:
- Cache purge,
- Statistics refreshing,
- Board disabling/enabling,
- (Un)Banning,
- Board configuration altering,
- SQL querying,
- ...

The embedded FAQ will provide much more details. You can also extend the API functionalities using a complete hook system.

The API has been made in order to complete a crucial need in phpBB: A strong & secure API.
